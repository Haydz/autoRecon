 further functionality
 https://hackertarget.com/7-nmap-nse-scripts-recon/

 This project is focused on intelligence automation from Nmap scans.
 IT currently does the following:

 1) Fast Nmap Scan to find hosts up - Done
 2) TOP 1000 PORTS TCP scan - Done changed to 2K
 3) Scan for common web ports - Done
 4) Run Eye Witness on common web ports - Done
 """

"""
 Yet to do:
 5) Enum4linux *done loneferret*
 6) connect all various NSE scripts up
 7) ftp scan - log in for anonymous, output success anonmyous logins - Partly
 8) snmp scans - private, community strings
 9) Nikto -done
 19 )dirbuster



 to mix in:
  discovery scan against a file of subnets
   default nmap with services (-sV) against up hosts, then full port scan with services against all up hosts (yes that will take a long time)
eyewitness stuff is cool. you should pull out what nmap returned as a www and pass those per scan
