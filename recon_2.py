"""
 this is a major work in progress
 IDEA: Using TCP dump to monitor for Arp Packets, collate IP address from ARP packets, then direct scan hosts.
 TO DO:
 Save files in separate directory using user input
 Add excluding own IP address
 ifconfig
 nmap 192.168.0.* --exclude 192.168.0.100

 further functionality
 https://hackertarget.com/7-nmap-nse-scripts-recon/

 This project is focused on intelligence automation from Nmap scans.
 IT currently does the following:

 1) Fast Nmap Scan to find hosts up
 2) TOP 1000 PORTS TCP scan
 3) Scan for common web ports
 4) Run Eye Witness on common web ports (in progress)
 """

"""
 Yet to do:
 5) Enum4linux *done loneferret*
 6) connect all various NSE scripts up
 7) ftp scan - log in for anonymous, output success anonmyous logins
 8) snmp scans - private, community strings
